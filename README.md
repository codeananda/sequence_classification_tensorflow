# Time-Series / Sequence Multiclass Classification - TensorFlow ‚åõ

This repo contains a write-up for the first stage of a paid project I completed for a client on Upwork. At the time of writing, we are waiting to start stage 2. The client was delighted with the work and left a 5-star review:

The task: build an attention-based model in TensorFlow to classify sequences into one of four categories. It achieved 97% accuracy.

This portfolio is a work in progress. It probably won't be in perfect condition when you read it. But I hope it gives you an idea of the quality of my work and what I can do.

# PyTorch and TensorFlow

I completed this project alongside a Senior Machine Learning Engineer [Waylon Flinn](https://github.com/waylonflinn). Waylon wrote a custom attention-based LSTM model which provided a significant gain in performance over vanialla LSTMs.
